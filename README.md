Raspberry Pi GPIO control with webservice

Minimal webservice that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi.
It allows the user to control certain output pins of the GPIO by clicking the corresponding button.
Permissions can be set so that only logged in users may switch an individual port on or off,
or the port can be 'public'.
